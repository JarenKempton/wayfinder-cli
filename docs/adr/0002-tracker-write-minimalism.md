# ADR 0002: Tracker write minimalism

## Decision

Tracker tickets hold scope, acceptance criteria, status, assignment, dependencies,
and artifact links. Implementation detail and validation evidence belong in
the linked artifact. Do not rewrite descriptions or post summaries to narrate
work already documented elsewhere. Child tickets inherit map context.

Resolution requires the configured completion gates and an artifact link.
A comment is not an inherent resolution requirement. The protocol-stable
`resolution_comments` capability remains optional and disabled by default;
organization policy governs enabling comments. Prompts do not independently
authorize closure or tracker writes.

Claim ownership belongs in tracker-native structured storage, not comments.
Verification and guarded restoration must read that ownership record. An adapter
without a safe structured mechanism must reject claiming. Structured storage
alone does not prove atomic exclusion; conditional behavior still requires
conformance evidence.

## Rationale

Duplicated narrative drifts and obscures the fields that coordinate work.
Separating ownership machinery from comments also keeps comment preferences
from weakening claim verification.

This is a policy decision, not evidence that every adapter enforces it.
[Tracker implementations](../../src/adapters/trackers/) and their conformance
tests determine supported behavior. Existing comments are history; this decision
does not authorize deleting them or invalidate in-flight ownership records.
See [organization policy](0003-organization-policy-and-enforced-configuration.md)
for the authority boundary.
