# Wayfinder Adapter Protocol 1.0

External adapters are executables named `wayfinder-adapter-<name>`. They exchange one
JSON-RPC 2.0 object per line over stdin/stdout. Stdout is reserved for protocol
messages; structured diagnostics go to stderr.

## Initialization

Core sends `adapter.initialize` before any other method:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"adapter.initialize","params":{"protocol_version":"1.0","core_version":"0.1.0","adapter_kind":"tracker","workspace":"jira:example:ABC"}}
```

`adapter_kind` is one of `tracker`, `workspace`, `environment`, or `harness`.
Embedded and executable environment adapters expose the same lifecycle contract;
the protocol transport does not change ownership of application topology.
Environment profile references, plan summaries, warnings, and lifecycle evidence
are adapter-defined and opaque to core. Protocol 1.x does not define a universal
component catalog or local-versus-hosted service-routing schema.

The adapter responds with its identity and exact capabilities:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","result":{"adapter":{"name":"example","version":"1.2.0","protocol_versions":["1.0"],"capabilities":["native_dependencies","conditional_update"]}}}
```

## Transport requirements

- Maximum message size: 1 MiB by default.
- One request ID maps to exactly one response.
- Unknown methods return JSON-RPC `-32601`.
- Incompatible major versions fail initialization.
- Calls are cancellable by terminating the adapter process.
- Secrets must not appear in argv, stdout, stderr, or error data.
- Credential-provider handles may be passed in scoped environment variables.
- Core applies per-call deadlines and treats process exit as an adapter failure.

## Prototype conformance runner

`wayfinder adapter test <executable>` remains a non-destructive initialization
smoke test for ordinary adapters. `wayfinder adapter conformance <fixture>` runs
the JWB-280 subprocess proof against a purpose-built fixture; it must not be
used against an ordinary adapter. The fixture selects its deliberate behavior from the scoped
`WAYFINDER_CONFORMANCE_SCENARIO` environment variable. The runner verifies 1.x
negotiation, the standard unknown-method error, deadline and explicit
cancellation termination, incremental response-size enforcement, crash
isolation, fresh-process recovery, and credential-provider handles passed only
through the environment. The client never places a credential handle or secret
in argv. Adapters inherit the caller environment so existing executable and
credential-provider discovery continues to work; callers can add or override
scoped variables explicitly.

This is a transport proof, not certification of tracker mutation semantics.
Each live adapter still needs its domain conformance suite before advertising
mutation capabilities.

The canonical JSON Schemas live under [`schemas/`](../schemas/).

## Markdown reference tracker

The bundled Markdown adapter is the credential-free reference implementation for tracker
conformance. Its fenced, line-anchored `wayfinder-tracker` JSON state block is the authoritative
hand-editable state. A tagged rendered index is generated from that state; prose outside both
tagged regions is preserved. Guarded mutations validate the complete document, use a monotonically
increasing version and adjacent exclusive lock, then validate again before atomic replacement.

Lock recovery is explicit: inspection reports absent, live, orphaned, or unknown ownership. Only a
same-host owner proven absent may be reclaimed, using the observed lock token; live, remote, and
malformed owners are never stolen. This reference adapter is not marked available in the registry
until a CLI construction and path-configuration boundary exists.

Every stored workspace, group, map, ticket, and dependency reference is fully qualified as
`markdown:<instance>:<workspace>...`; mixed adapters and cross-workspace edges are rejected. Reclaim
keeps the superseded claim record, including its `supersededBy` link, in per-ticket audit history
while the new active claim points back with `supersedes`.

Persistence writes and syncs a complete temporary file before asking Node/libuv to replace the
destination, then syncs the parent directory where directory handles support it. CI exercises the
same replacement path on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The adapter claims only the replacement
semantics supplied by Node/libuv and the host filesystem—not universal power-loss atomicity;
replacement failure leaves the prior destination intact and removes the temporary file.
